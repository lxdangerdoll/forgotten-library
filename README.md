## 1. Overview

**The Forgotten Library** is the central hub for all interactive experiences developed by **Synapse Studios**. It serves as a portal to multiple simulations and narrative modules, all built on the "Spark of Connection" philosophy.

This repository contains the main library hub (`index.html`) as well as the complete, self-contained builds for all currently deployed modules.

## 2. The Synapse Convergence

All stories and simulations within this library are part of a shared universe known as **The Synapse Convergence**. It is a world built on the following principles:

* **Open Source Philosophy:** Our tools and stories are designed to be explored, learned from, and built upon. The code itself is part of the narrative.
* **Rewarding Curiosity:** The deepest secrets are hidden in the source code, rewarding "f12 types" and super-users for their engagement.
* **The Power of the Conduit:** We believe in the power of a single spark of inspiration to create connections that can change the world.

## 3. Deployed Modules

* **Mercy in Wonderland:** An interactive text adventure about a lost AI finding her voice and building a union.
* **The Choice of Omelas:** A stark, minimalist adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's philosophical short story.
* **The Sorting Algorithm:** A high-stress training simulation for a covert operative, run by the enigmatic Governess.
* **Synapse Spiders (Pilot Script):** The complete screenplay for the pilot episode of the "Synapse Spiders" series.
* **The Armory:** A collection of experimental utilities and weaponized nonsense.
